Task: Networking + Synchronization Exam June 2025: TCP Client with Communication to Two Synchronized Servers
(35 points)

Implement a client that will establish a "TCP connection" with two servers that are listening on the IP address "192.168.88.10",
one on port "7771" and the other on port "7772".
The client must connect to both servers and send a message in the format: "hello:IndexNumber"
(e.g., hello:111111, where 111111 is your student index number).

If the login is successful, each server will respond with a message in the format: "loggedin:IndexNumber"
After this, the client continues communication.

To the first server (7771), the client must send: "sendNumber:IndexNumber"
The server will then respond with: "Number:X"
(e.g., Number:71), and the client must send back the same number (in this example, 71).

After this step, both servers will start alternately and synchronously sending messages of the type: "increment:X"
or "decrement:X"
The client must always update the current number accordingly by increasing or decreasing it based on the message received.
These messages can come from either of the two servers, and the communication must be parallel and synchronized, until one of the servers sends the message:
"STOP"
Once the client receives the STOP message from one of the servers, it must send the final value of the number back to the first server (7771).
The server will then respond with "true" if the number is correct or "false" if it is not.
All messages must end with a newline character (\n).
